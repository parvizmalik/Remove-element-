# Remove-element
solution in Python , JS

The given solution for the "Remove Element" problem on LeetCode removes all instances of the value `val` from the list `nums`.
Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a variable `index` to 0. This variable is used to keep track of where we should place the next number in the modified `nums` list.
2. Loop over each value in the `nums` list with the iterator `i`.
3. Check if `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`.
4. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, then:
   a. Assign the value of `nums[i]` to `nums[index]`.
   b. Increment `index` by 1.
5. If `nums[i]` is equal to `val`, then the loop simply continues to the next iteration without taking any action.
6. Return the `index`, which represents the length of the modified `nums` list (i.e., the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`).

For your specific call, `solution.removeElement([1,2,3,4], 4)`, the function will remove the value `4` from the list and return `3`. The list `nums` will be modified to `[1,2,3]`.

To answer your specific question, when `nums[i] = val`, no actions are taken. This is intentional, because the goal is to remove the element with value `val`. By not taking any action when `nums[i] = val`, that element is effectively skipped over, and the `index` does not increment, leaving a gap in the modified list where the `val` element used to be. At the end of the loop, all elements after `index` can be considered removed, and the modified list is of length `index`.
